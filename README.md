# 42 Common Core Projects:

This is the repository with the projects carried out during my studies in 42 Warsaw 

## 1. Libft
This is the very first project when starting at 42 Warsaw.
It consists of creating a library from scratch, entirely in the C language.
I had to recode general-purpose functions to understand how they work and learn how to use them.
This library will be used in future projects within the common core.
