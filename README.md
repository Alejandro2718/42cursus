# 42 Common Core Projects:

This is the repository with the projects carried out during my studies in 42 Warsaw
by [Alejandro Jimenez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-jimenez2718/)

## 1. Libft
This is the very first project when starting at 42 Warsaw.
It consists of creating a library from scratch, entirely in the C language.
I had to recode general-purpose functions to understand how they work and learn how to use them.
This library will be used in future projects within the common core.

## 2. Born2beRoot
This project introduces you to system administration and virtualization.
The task is to set up a virtual machine from scratch, configure a secure server environment without a graphical interface, and implement strict security protocols.
Key tasks include configuring SSH, firewalls, encrypted partitions, strong password policies, and setting up a monitoring script.
The project also emphasizes learning about Linux-based system security tools like SELinux, AppArmor, and sudo.
This experience lays the foundation for future system administration projects and deepens your understanding of server setup and security.
