# üñ•Ô∏è Born2beroot üñ•Ô∏è
The "Born2beRoot" project is an introduction to the world of system administration.
The focus is on creating a virtual machine using VirtualBox (or UTM) and setting up a server with strict rules.
Throughout this project, I needed to install and configure an operating system (such as Debian or Rocky) without
a graphical interface, while following tight security and configuration guidelines. Key tasks included setting up a firewall,
creating encrypted partitions, configuring secure passwords, and writing a script to monitor the system.
I also dove into configuring services like SSH and sudo, and I did the additional part where I set up a fully functional website hosted locally.

## üóùÔ∏è Key learning points:
- Virtualization and Virtual Machine Management: I learned how to create and manage virtual machines using tools like VirtualBox or UTM, focusing on properly configuring the operating system.

- System Security: By setting up firewalls, password policies, and using tools like SELinux or AppArmor, I gained an understanding of how to secure a system and apply best practices in security.

- Partitioning and Encryption: I got hands-on with LVM (Logical Volume Management) to create encrypted partitions, a vital skill for data protection.

- User and Permission Management: I configured users, groups, and privileges, like setting up a secure sudo system and implementing strong password policies.

- Automation with Scripts: I developed a Bash script to monitor the system, learning how to gather and display system information and automate tasks using cron.

- Networking Services Knowledge: I set up and secured an SSH service, learned how to handle network connections, and tweaked configurations as needed.
